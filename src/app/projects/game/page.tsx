  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
    This project was created as part of my <span className="font-semibold">Creative Digital Media Production A-Level</span>, 
    where I explored the exciting process of designing and building digital experiences. 
    Developed in <span className="font-semibold">Construct 3</span>, this 2D platformer was my very first step into 
    the world of game development. 
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    The game features classic mechanics like jumping, obstacles, and collectible items, 
    but what made it special was the creative process behind it: from developing 
    characters and level designs to experimenting with gameplay flow and player engagement. 
    It was a hands-on way to combine both my <span className="font-semibold">technical curiosity</span> 
    and my <span className="font-semibold">creative storytelling</span>.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    This project represents more than just a game ‚Äî it‚Äôs a milestone that showed me 
    how much I enjoy building interactive experiences. It also opened the door to 
    pursuing future projects in <span className="font-semibold">games, media, and software development</span>. 
    Looking back, I see this as the foundation that shaped my ambitions to keep creating, 
    innovating, and pushing myself into bigger projects.
